As a Scrum Master, you do much more than JUST facilitate the meeting, you are an observer of the system with the aim to help the system to find it's way to be it's best. 
And you are definetely not to 'run' the meeting specially it's contents.

Here a list of questions for you to notice and instrospect:
#### Basics to observe
* cover only top items? (ie avoid waste trying to predict the future)
* PO is clear and concise
* PO focus on impact/value (rather than 'move buttom 3 mm to the right)
* Does the team ask questions to clarify?
* Are team members surface when is not clear the progress/feasibility of goals?
* Is there engagement about the aim of the items at hand?
* Are the discussions around the purpose/what to achieve?

#### Measure
* Are the pending clarifications sorted by Planning?
* Are the product increment items not ready moved out
* Are the very big items sliced so that can be consumed in digestable pieces?
* Scope & bureaucracy creep are snapped nice & early

#### Team self-awareness
* Does the team leave energised?
* Are problems & impediments being surfaced?
* The team adjust & offers help when items are slowing the aim down
* Do we hold each other accountable, for what we agreed to do from refinement session??

At the end of the day, Refinement is there as a brief touch point for checking the very top backlog items, surface questions and 'polish up' whats coming to ensure is ready for the team to be able to work on it. 
* Is this happening?
