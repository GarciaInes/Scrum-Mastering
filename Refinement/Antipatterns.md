Listing below some anti-patterns often observed in teams on the Refinement activity
### No Routine
There isn't a rythm on when what how who
* Antidote: Get that muscle memory going! Same time, same place, for & by the team, so that they are ready for alignment.

### Fuzzy Future
Looking at things are not inmediate too far out, convolutes the goal at hand. Revisign the product vision is helpful but avoid unnecesary uncertainly and wishes/predicions too far into the future.
* Antidote: Back to basics, look at the top hot items coming up. Focus on the impact: requirements is not what brings value, but what people can DO.

### Problem Solving
Avoid jumping into solutionsing, pointers are useful, yet dont deviate
* Antidote: the aim of refinement is undersatand the aim, ask questions, clarify items and gaps, so that pending information and decisions can be gathered 'just in time' for start of new sprint.

### No Red Dots
*Wikipedia*: A red dot sight is a common classification for a type of non-magnifying reflector sight for firearms, and other devices that require aiming, that gives the user a point of aim in the form of an illuminated red dot.
* Antidote: prompt questions to help the team to surface those

### Monologs
Does everyone have a similar air time? Do people contribute to the items discussed?
* Antidote: its ok to pause, and gear back to the upcoming common goal, and the pieces that supports it.

### Cluelessness
Lack of synch within the team, no clear idea
* Antidote: refocus on the goal, what are we attacking next sprint and show as working increment on following Friday?

### Overcrowded
Too many people who don't bring value
* Antidote: refocus, thats for and by the team, anyone else either is helping towards the upcoming common goal or out. Reduce noise, bring focus.
