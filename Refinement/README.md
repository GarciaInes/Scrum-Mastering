In the Scrum framework the **Refinenment** is one of the check points added the latests as an often practice that happens couple days before the start of a new cycle/sprint. 
There are multiple reasons why is only a couple of days prior new sprint starting. 
* Reduce context switch and attention diversion from the team.
* Reduce deviation from a far future. The closest to the current state, the easiest to assess.
* Time restriction acts to shorten turnaround decisions and aim for clarity.

SEMANTICS: There is a reason to use the word **Refinement** instead of 'grooming' as in certain cultures comes with quite negative connotations, the words that we use are important so that we don't just throw people off but we enhance what and why we are doing.

## Strategy is a commodity, execution is an art. â€“ Peter Drucker

[*Scrum Guide Refinement mention under Product Backlog ref*] (https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#product-backlog)

The Refinement gives the opportunityt to the team to check top items in the backlog and bounce thoughs and questions that may need to be brushed off before the new cycle. Also where you can break down and further defining Product Backlog items into smaller more precise items. This is an ongoing activity to add details, such as a description, order, and size. 

#### There you have the why, the purpose. Now,

* What [**Indicators**](https://github.com/GarciaInes/Scrum-Mastering/blob/main/Refinement/Indicators.md) can measure to know where you stand?

* Which powerful [**Questions**](https://github.com/GarciaInes/Scrum-Mastering/blob/main/Refinement/Questions.md) can you ask to help your team?

* Things to be careful of, aka [**Antipatterns**](https://github.com/GarciaInes/Scrum-Mastering/blob/main/Refinement/Antipatterns.md)


## The aim is to have enough to get us started

Only focus to the very top items of the backlog
Slide the pie to bite size items
Attributes often vary with the domain of work
Is it clear enough, understand what it's been asked for and why
Do as little as needed, remember:

## The art of maximising the work not done

Don't try to over do it, focus on the very top items in the backlog so that:
1. they are still relevant
2. are in order of importance, urgency AND return
3. sliced so that can be consumed at least 1 a day
4. enough information to get us started
5. clarity from all team what is about AND most importantly WHY
