In the Scrum framework the **Refinenment** is one of the check points added the latests as an often practice that happens couple days before the start of a new cycle/sprint. 

## Strategy is a commodity, execution is an art. â€“ Peter Drucker

[*Scrum Guide Refinement mention under Product Backlog ref*] (https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#product-backlog)

The Refinement gives the opportunityt to the team to check top items in the backlog and bounce thoughs and questions that may need to be brushed off before the new cycle. Also where you can break down and further defining Product Backlog items into smaller more precise items. This is an ongoing activity to add details, such as a description, order, and size.

## The aim is to have enough to get us started

Only focus to the very top items of the backlog
Slide the pie to bite size items
Attributes often vary with the domain of work
Is it clear enough, understand what it's been asked for and why
Do as little as needed, remember:

## The art of maximising the work not done

Don't try to over do it, focus on the very top items in the backlog so that:
1. they are still relevant
2. are in order of importance, urgency AND return
3. sliced so that can be consumed at least 1 a day
4. enough information to get us started
5. clarity from all team what is about AND most importantly WHY
