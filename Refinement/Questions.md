### Backlog health
* Is the backlog is visible, relevant & up to date?
* Are the items at the top are ready with enough information to get the team started?
* Are the items at the top are small enough for the team to complete in a day or half?
* Is the backlog 1 dimensional priority list?
* Are the backlog items rounded value? ie can be used on its completion and iterate upon?

### Story in question
* If you could have this tomorrow what would include?
* Thats the 'happy path' how else it could be used/called/triggered/handled?
* Do we have enough info to get started?
* How would we monitor how it performs?
* How could that monitoring be proactive? (rather than the usual reacitve)

### INVEST: 
#### * _independent, negotiable, valuable, estimable, small, and testable work items?_

### Team checks
* The team has all skills needed to bring backlog items to Done?
* Team members not locked into specific roles (anyone can pull work / no pre-assignment)
* Does everyone know if the release plan still matches reality? 
* is that release plan visible & easy to digest?
