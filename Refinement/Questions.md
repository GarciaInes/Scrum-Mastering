### Shake things up
If you want to shake things up a bit from routine, which can kill creativity and energy, try to open up the refinement conversation which questions such as:
* What would you like to do?
* What are we missing here?
* If there was no backlog, what should we be doing next?

### Backlog health
* Is the backlog visible?
* Is the backlog ordered in: Importance, Urgency & Return of the effort?
* Is the backlog relevant & up to date?
* Are the items at the top are ready with enough information to get the team started?
* Are the items at the top are small enough for the team to complete in a day or half?
* Is the backlog 1 dimensional priority list?
* Are the backlog items rounded value? ie can be used on its completion and iterate upon?

### Story in question
* Is there the WHY of this product backlog item?
* How does it fit with the existing parts?
* If you could have this tomorrow what would include?
* Thats the 'happy path' how else it could be used/called/triggered/handled?
* Do we have enough info to get started?
* How would we monitor how it performs?
* How could that monitoring be proactive? (rather than the usual reacitve)

### INVEST: 
#### * _independent, negotiable, valuable, estimable, small, and testable work items?_

### Team checks
* Is clarity from all team what is about AND most importantly WHY?
* The team has all skills needed to bring backlog items to Done?
* Team members not locked into specific roles (anyone can pull work / no pre-assignment)
* Does everyone know if the release plan still matches reality? 
* is that release plan visible & easy to digest?

An often flaw on the Refinement is from PO perspective asking closed questions such as "is this clear?" Move to other tactiques to ensure there is clarity on the Backlog Item in question, such as "could you play back whats this story about?"

### Bigger Picture
#### Desirable?
* Who are the target customers for our solution?
* What problem do our customers want to solve? 
* How do our customers solve this problem today?
* Why canâ€™t our customers solve this problem today?
* What is the outcome our customers want to achieve?
* Why will our customers stop using their current solution?

#### Viable?
* What are our main acquisition channels for obtaining new customers?
* How will our customers repeatedly use our solution?
* Why will our customers refer us to new customers?
* How does this solution support our company vision?
* Who are the primary competitors to our solution?
* How will our solution generate revenue?

#### Feasible?
* What are our biggest technical or engineering challenges?
* What are our biggest legal or regulatory risks?
* What are our internal governance or policy hurdles?
* Why does our leadership team supports this solution?
* Where does our funding for this solution come from?
* Why is our team uniquely positioned to win?

#### Gaps
* Why do you think this is known when I think it is unknown?
* Why do you believe this is important when I believe it is unimportant?
* What are the intended and unintended consequences of this product or service feature?
* Within these intended and unintended consequences, which are positive?
* Within these intended and unintended consequences, which are negative?
