## “What is Sprint Planning”, Scrum,  
https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-sprint-planning

#### When planning sessions become ultra-marathons<br/>
Ringfence time for the session, that is 1)capacity to craft the goal and 2)plan what top backlog items are required and feasible to achieve it<br/>
Remove the noise, focus on what matters<br/>
One dimentional organised list work trhough top until *enough* to consume this cycle<br/>
The team can always pull more in if finished (fully finished = deployable state by a simple button press)<br/>
Reduce distractions, burden and overload<br/>

#### Too much to cope<br/>
In line with ABOVE<br/>
The feasibility of the work is forecasted on past performance, upcoming capacity & DoD <br/>
Does the team believes the plan is achievable? (avoid group think)<br/>
Overcommitting can lead to burnout, missed deadlines, and a lack of trust from stakeholders. <br/>

#### Lack of clarity<br/>
If the team is unclear on what they need to do, this can lead to misunderstandings, miscommunication, and wasted time. <br/>
Antidote: Work on your refinement. Poorly defined user stories or acceptance criteria hinders along the way.<br/>
Antidote: Try practices like 'the 3 amigos' 2 short touch points to align and surface considerations.<br/>

#### Draining Planning talking about to far off potential future<br/>
Instead of old-school upfront detail planning goes to the bin, bye bye!<br/> 
We can’t predict the future and we know that things are going to change, so there is no point in investing time, effort or intelligence in that. <br/>

#### When we are told what to do: when noone asks questions nor offer comments<br/>
Are we in the same page?<br/>
Team can refine items during this process, which increases understanding & confidence.<br/>

#### *Del dicho al hecho hay un trecho* > Saying when actual and agreements differs. = lack of cohesion<br/>
Seek input from all team is considered and responded to. <br/>
Even if we disagree we commit.<br/>

#### Failure to prioritize
Is not only the danger of eningd up working on low-value tasks or tasks that are not important to stakeholders, but also clear and concise direction goes along way.<br/>
Seek impact, focus on what matters. <br/>
Favour finish over starting (Kanban mindset) <br/>

#### When planning is a continum of previous sprint<br/>
Each item is up for pushing back into backlog, what we are really setting us up to do?<br/>
What is the goal of this sprint? and what are the required 'pieces' for it to be achieved.<br/>
Else can wait <br/>
The Product Owner eill be a big help on this.<br/>

#### When assigning tickets is expected<br/>
Sometimes a team just need to be explicitely given the permission to own their own destiny<br/>
What is stopping us to pick the next item from the top? (growing opportunity)<br/>

### WATCH OUT
* Group Think
* Shopping List
* Lack of goal / clear direction
* Ends with a confused team (watch non verbal)
* Team members are holding back from one another
* Sense of artificial harmony
* Higher entity assigning tickets
