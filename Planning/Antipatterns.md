### “What is Sprint Planning”, Scrum,  
https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-sprint-planning

##### When planning sessions become ultra-marathons<br/>
Remove the noise, focus on what matters<br/>
One dimentional organised list work trhough top until *enough* to consume this cycle<br/>
The team can always pull more in if finished (fully finished = deployable state by a simple button press)<br/>
Reduce distractions, burden and overload<br/>

##### Too much to cope<br/>
In line with ABOVE<br/>
The feasibility of the work is forecasted on past performance, upcoming capacity & DoD<br/>
Does the team believes the plan is achievable? (avoid group think)<br/>

##### Draining Planning talking about to far off potential future<br/>
Instead of old-school upfront detail planning goes to the bin, bye bye!<br/> 
We can’t predict the future and we know that things are going to change, so there is no point in investing time, effort or intelligence in that. <br/>

##### When we are told what to do: when noone asks questions nor offer comments<br/>
Are we in the same page?<br/>
Team can refine items during this process, which increases understanding & confidence.<br/>

##### *Del dicho al hecho hay un trecho* > Saying when actual and agreements differs. = lack of cohesion<br/>
Seek input from all team is considered and responded to. <br/>
Even if we disagree we commit.<br/>

## “We plan, but recognize the limits of planning in a turbulent environment.” - Agile Manifesto

### WATCH OUT
* Group Think
* Shopping List
* Lack of goal / clear direction
* Ends with a confused team (watch non verbal)
* Team members are holding back from one another
* Sense of artificial harmony
