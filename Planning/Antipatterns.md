### “What is Sprint Planning”, Scrum,  
https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-sprint-planning

* When planning sessions become ultra-marathons
Remove the noise, focus on what matters
One dimentional organised list work trhough top until *enough* to consume this cycle
The team can always pull more in if finished (fully finished = deployable state by a simple button press)
Reduce distractions, burden and overload

* Too much to cope
In line with ABOVE
The feasibility of the work is forecasted on past performance, upcoming capacity & DoD
Does the team believes the plan is achievable? (avoid group think)

* Draining Planning talking about to far off potential future
Instead of old-school upfront detail planning goes to the bin, bye bye! We can’t predict the future and we know that things are going to change, so there is no point in investing time, effort or intelligence in that. 

* When we are told what to do: when noone asks questions nor offer comments
Are we in the same page?
Team can refine items during this process, which increases understanding & confidence.

* *Del dicho al hecho hay un trecho* > Saying when actual and agreements differs. = lack of cohesion
Seek input from all team is considered and responded to. 
Even if we disagree we commit.

## “We plan, but recognize the limits of planning in a turbulent environment.” - Agile Manifesto

### WATCH OUT
* Group Think
* Shopping List
* Lack of goal / clear direction
* Ends with a confused team (watch non verbal)
* Team members are holding back from one another
* Sense of artificial harmony
