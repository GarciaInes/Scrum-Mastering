As a Scrum Master, you do much more than JUST facilitate the meeting, you are an observer of the system with the aim to help the system to find it's way to be it's best. 
And you are definetely not to 'run' the meeting specially it's contents.

Here a list of questions for you to notice and instrospect:
#### Basics to observe
* Does the Whole team participate?
* Are problems & impediments being surfaced?
* Concise updates on what was Achieved last 24h & plan to Finish next 24h?
* Gives clarity & progress as a whole towards the common goal

#### Measure
* Are team members surface when is not clear the progress/feasibility of that common goal?
* Do we hold each other accountable, for what we signed up to do?
* Scope & bureaucracy creep are snapped nice & early
* Team meets throughout the day for more detailed discussions & progress when needed

#### Team self-awareness
* Does the team member give an opportunity for others to contribute?
* Does people realise and adjust when 'hoarding the mic'?
* The team adjust & offers help when items are slowing the aim down
* Is it a collective effort? (ie avoid, my ticket, my area, feature 'heroes' / silos


At the end of the day, Planning is there as a touch point for aligment and for the team to define the Sprint Goal and how can it be achieved. Keeping time and quality fixed, whilst adjusting how to make the sprint goal happen as a collective.
* Is this happening?
