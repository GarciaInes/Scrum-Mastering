As a Scrum Master, you do much more than JUST facilitate the meeting, you are an observer of the system with the aim to help the system to find it's way to be it's best. 
And you are definetely there not to 'run' the meeting specially it's contents.

Here a list of questions for you to notice and instrospect:
#### Basics to observe
* Does the Whole team participate?
* Do some voices over rule others? how? why?
* Are problems & impediments being surfaced?
* Is there a clear crafted goal? Focus on Value to aim, not on volume of activities.
* Gives clarity & progress as a whole towards the common goal

#### Measure
* Are team members surface when is not clear the progress/feasibility of that common goal?
* Do we hold each other accountable, for what we signed up to do?
* Scope & bureaucracy creep are snapped nice & early
* Looking at last 3-4 sprints is the volume of stories feasible? (as SM is good to have that number in mind, to snap the conversation at that point when you reach that)
* Team meets throughout the day for more detailed discussions & progress when needed

#### Team self-awareness
* Does the team member give an opportunity for others to contribute?
* Does people realise and adjust when 'hoarding the mic'?
* The team adjust & offers help when items are slowing the aim down
* Is it a collective effort? (ie avoid, my ticket, my area, feature 'heroes' / silos


At the end of the day, Planning is there as a touch point for aligment and for the team to define the Sprint Goal and how can it be achieved. Keeping time and quality fixed, whilst adjusting how to make the sprint goal happen as a collective.
* Is this happening?
