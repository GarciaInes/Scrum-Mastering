In the Scrum framework the **Planning** is one of the events that kicksoff each of your cycle/sprint. You do this at the beginning of every iteration, let’s say on Mondays.

## "In preparing for battle I have always found that plans are useless, but planning is indispensable." - Dwight D. Eisenhower

In planning, keep this in mind; even read up to the team to set the tone: 
Any great team want to have predictability of cadence and come together with every short cycle to craft their plan of attack.
Things will evolve and change, laying out the work and define out goal and what we commit to achieve as a team is key.

Start things it’s easy.
Finish is not.
Only finished things bring value.
Having many in progress things do not" - Ines Garcia
