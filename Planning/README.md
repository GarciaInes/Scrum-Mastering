## "In preparing for battle I have always found that plans are useless, but planning is indispensable." - Dwight D. Eisenhower

In planning keep this in mind even read up to the team to set the tone: 
Any great team want to have predictability of cadence and come together with every short cycle to craft their plan of attack.

Only finished things bring value.
Having many in progress things do not" - Ines Garcia
