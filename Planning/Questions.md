### Seeking clarity

* What is the need here to meet? (moving to goals/aim rather than instructions/features)
* What is this related to? (draw dependencies/impact)
* Why this chasllenge matter? (find purpose)

### What can be committed

* What can we feasibly consume?
* What is the minimum to get us started?
* Do we have enough to get started?
* What can we show as working product on Friday?
* How could easiest document what we are about to do?

#### Part of Planning is estimating, beaware ideal time and elapsed time are different things. 
* Use relative estimation (not absolute) then compare to others, is this bigger or smaller? fetch input from all not just louder voices
* What is our capacity? 
* What is our focus work / uninterrupted?
* How many elapsed hours of elapsed time we have a day?
* What may help to improve it?
* Are we accounting for Done-Done? (ie review the definition of Done against each story the team wants to commit, is it feasible?)


### How would it be done

#### Size
* Can it be done including assurance, security and fit to existing parts in less than a half a cycle?
* If you had a magic wand, what would be the first thing needed for users to start using it?
* What is the bear minimum for most impact and least disruption?
* What is the cost of not utilising it yet? How to slice it to deliver sooner?
* What could be one more option?
* How to decouple for lean pipeline?

#### Integrated
* What are the dependencies on this piece of work?
* Is this an increment of existing workflow?
* How could it be an interdependent yet modular component?
* Is there a framework in place we could repurpose? take advantage of?
* How did we solved similar items in the past?
* Does anything like this already exist? Anywhere?
* What are the top three area that it impacts?
* Who will be affected by this change?
* How would we monitor its performance?

#### Validation
* How would it be adopted? Can it be organic? 
* Do we know how to reach the actual users?
* How to measure its use?
* What would be the simplest way to proactively monitor it?
* Are we attempting to change user behavior? How could it be eased?
* Does this introduce new patterns?
* What are the traidoffs?
* What reservations or concerns do you have?
* What impact do we hope this will have?
* What are the assumptions that we are making?
* What else could this be/could we investigate/have left out?
* What may be in our way?
