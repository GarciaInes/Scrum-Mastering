👍🎉 First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! 🎉👍

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Scrum-Mastery and its packages, which are hosted in the Scrum-Mastery on GitHub. 
These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

In the [README file](https://github.com/GarciaInes/Scrum-Mastery/blob/main/README.md) you will find the purpose and goal of this open project, also brief how to use GitHub.
Please read the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/GarciaInes/Scrum-Mastery/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and [Licence agreement](https://github.com/GarciaInes/Scrum-Mastery/blob/main/LICENCE.rtfd.zip).


### Git Commit Messages
 * Use Markdown
 * Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
 * Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
 * Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
 * Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:
🎨 :art: when improving the format/structure of the code
🐎 :racehorse: when improving performance
📝 :memo: when writing docs
🐛 :bug: when fixing a bug
🔥 :fire: when removing code or files 
✅ :white_check_mark: when adding tests
🔒 :lock: when dealing with security
⬆️ :arrow_up: when upgrading dependencies
⬇️ :arrow_down: when downgrading dependencies

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:
```
$ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
> 
> A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
> ```
