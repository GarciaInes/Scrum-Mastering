👍🎉 First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! 🎉👍

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Scrum-Mastery and its packages, which are hosted in the Scrum-Mastery on GitHub. 
These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

In the README file you will find the purpose and goal of this open project, also brief how to use GitHub.
Please read the Code and Conduct and Licence agreement.

###Git Commit Messages
 * Use Markdown
 * Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
 * Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
 * Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
 * Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:
🎨 :art: when improving the format/structure of the code
🐎 :racehorse: when improving performance
📝 :memo: when writing docs
🐛 :bug: when fixing a bug
🔥 :fire: when removing code or files 
✅ :white_check_mark: when adding tests
🔒 :lock: when dealing with security
⬆️ :arrow_up: when upgrading dependencies
⬇️ :arrow_down: when downgrading dependencies

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:
```
$ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
> 
> A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
> ```
