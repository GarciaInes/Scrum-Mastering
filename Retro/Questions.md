Questions in retrospective can make a big difference. What you want is to guide the discussion to a place the team haven't been before so that they can access new information. Where you add 'color' but not substance, meaning avoid infusing your opinion, thought process and solution ideas to them.

Before the retro, block sometime to think about: 
* What would the team be talking about?
* What questions should you even be asking?

### Get data & set scene

* What is the context for it?
* What context is relevant?
* what is the surrounding environment?
* What is the data telling us? Are there any obvious themes? How about patterns? Why is it significant?
* Why is this experience significant?
* What are the implications?
* Why does it matter?
* What explains whats happening? why?
* What factors underlines it?
* What causes it/helps make it happen?

Note (rather than a question): There are many unkowns/things are changing fast. This is complex stuff. So we will make mistakes, things will not go as expected, not everything will work.

### Build upon what works
* What went well during the sprint/iteration, and how can we build on those successes in the future?
* What skills or strengths did team members bring to the table that helped us succeed, and how can we leverage those skills more effectively in the future?
* Were there any new practices or approaches that we tried during the sprint/iteration that worked particularly well, and how can we continue to incorporate those practices into our work?
* Did we have a clear understanding of our goals and priorities? If so, how can we maintain that clarity going forward?
* Were there any challenges or roadblocks that we overcame particularly well, and how can we apply that problem-solving approach to future challenges?
* Which specific behaviors or attitudes (that team members exhibited) contributed to this sprint? and how can we encourage more of those behaviors/attitudes going forward?

### To help bring people in the conversation, try:
* What is your take?
* Whats on your mind?
* How might you break that down into smaller problems?
* How could we handle this habit?
* How could we measure this?
* XX, if you were advising a friend on this (ie happier, safer whatever), what would you say to them?
* What is here that you want to explore?
* Imagine, it’s 30 days from now…what would you wish you had done today?
* Whose perspective fo we have? which ones are we missing?
* (When you discuss something new/trikcy) This is totally new territory for us, so I'm going to need everyone's input.
* Bob, you look concerned. Whats on your mind?
* Jes, you haven't said much. Whats your take/ input?
* LT, what are you hearing from home/train/road? 

### To help bring content if the engagement/content is a bit stale:
* Lets do a round, what is our shared context here?
* What could be one more option?
* What are the traidoffs?
* What could be the bear minimum for most impact and least disruption?
* If you had a magic wand, what would be the wish/spell?
* What is the cost of not utilising it yet?
* What is most useful to you as a team?
* What have we accomplished already?
* (only 1 option, break free) Okay, that's one side/option.. Let's hear some dissent/who's got something to add/let's have some give-and-take.

### To go deeper:
* What do you mean by ___?
* Where and how is defined?
* Can you help me understand what do you mean when you say ___?
* What would a simpler way look like?
* Can you tell me more about that?
* What would an experiment look like?
* What sort of behaviours or attitudes will make it easier to do this?
* When you say ______, what do you mean?
* What’s already working that you can build on?

### Assumption mapping
Reality check when coming up with tangible actions:
* Desirable: Do they want this? (us and or other dependent parties)
* Feasible: Can we do this? (time, energy, headspace, accesses and tools ...)
* Viable: Should we do this?
* Which values do we need to bring to like in the way we do things?

### Forward facing
* What would you prefer happen next time
* What outcome do you hope to get
* What is the desired impact?
* How would you solve this problem next time
* What would you like to see different about this situation
* If this situation happens again, how should we react to it?
* What will we do if one or more comes across as going disjoined?
* What are our options?
* What possible futures exist here?
* What would be one more way to solve it?
* How else we could influence it?

### Safety
* This is totally new territory for us, so I am going to need everyone's input.
* There are many unknowns/things changing fast/this is complex stuff. so we all make mistakes.
* What are the assumptions that we are making?
* What else could this be/could we investigate/have left out?
* How do we want to behave/choose/decide/act when things get difficult?
* What may be in our way?
* Ok, thats one side, let's hear some dissent. who's got something to add? lets have some give-take.
* Bob, what are you hearing that resonates?/concerns? (bring people into the conversation)
* Ddi everything go as smoothly as we would have liked?
* What were friction points?
* Are there systems we should retool?
* I really appreciate your bringing this to the table, I'm sure it wasn't easy.
* How  will we successfully challenge each other without damaging our relationships?


Decide what to do: ie out of the insights everyone shared, what are highlights/tangible actions each is going to do after leaving the session. The value is not just in being present and participate but in the actions the conversation has prompted.

Thank for all inputs, appreciate the tangible outcome and make host to do a round (or everyone to pick the next one) for a wrap up statement of the session and bring it to an end.
