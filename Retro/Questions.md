Decide what to do: ie out of the insights everyone shared, what are highlights/tangible actions each is going to do after leaving the session. The value is not just in being present and participate but in the actions the conversation has prompted.

Thank for all inputs, appreciate the tangible outcome and make host to do a round (or everyone to pick the next one) for a wrap up statement of the session and bring it to an end.
