* Ambiguity
* Fear of conflict (false sense of harmony)
* Silent retro
* Avoidance of accountability ie always external issue, where 'power' sits to change things
* Same old content coming up
* Inattention to results
* Absence of trust
* Planning is based on 'activites' rather than deliverables
* Estimates being commitments? Which problems does this cause? How can the team change this missconception/perception?
* Multitasking, even beyond the retro. How does that affect the project? what could be done to reduce the negative impacts?
* Retro ends without specific tangible actions to try next week

*“You think that because you understand ‘one’ that you must therefore understand ‘two’ because one and one make two. But you forget that you must also understand ‘and’.” - Sufi teaching story* 

### Antidotes
* Set scene of problem solvers with a common challenge
* Spend time BREAKING dependencies, rather than managing them
* Favour finishing over starting
* Move to experiements over broad statements
* Craft time to enable space for actions options generations & selection
* Prompt to options diversification, encourage other points of view and reassure healthy challenges as part of the process to get to a better options/views
* Focus on collectively chose 1-2 actions to start trying out next day (least for maximum return)
* Make it fun! sprinkle a bit of laughter can help ease and open minds which enables looking at constrains and reocurring issues with new lens

#### New lens 
Use Systems Thinking, its a way of looking at the world as series of interconnected webs (systems within systems and which are interacting and contradicting)
Systems have multiple layers of context and gives a metaview.
We often foccus only on analysis, or whats call reductionism, decompose and check each part isolated. When a single part optimization is not enough use Synthesis specially when thre is high interconnectivity and relationships rather than describe with static properties (as analysis would do)
Check for Elements and Connections, as a system causes its own behaviour. Find small leavers that can make a big difference, a positive one beyond your team.

#### Timing is everything
Are the retros poorly attended? Sometimes can simply be because the meeting is at a bad time or on a bad day. Have you asked?
When would it be good moment in each cadence to do it? (not 'if' to do it, but 'when' to do it)
