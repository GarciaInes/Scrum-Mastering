* Ambiguity - not clearly stating the facts
* Fear of conflict (false sense of harmony)
* Silent retro - and what is not said
* Lack of participation from some - not all voices being heard
* Canceling - "we dont have time"
* Avoidance of accountability ie always external issue, where 'power' sits to change things - us vs them
* Same old content coming up - constrains not addressed/progressed
* Inattention to results
* Over-analyzing: When the team becomes too focused on analyzing data or metrics, rather than discussing the team's overall performance and processes.
* Absence of trust
* Planning is based on 'activites' rather than deliverables
* Estimates being commitments? Which problems does this cause? How can the team change this missconception/perception?
* Multitasking, even beyond the retro. How does that affect the project? what could be done to reduce the negative impacts?
* Retro ends without specific tangible actions to try next week
* Finger pointing (or blaming each other rather than finding solutions to improve the team's processes and outcomes)
* Groupthink: When team members conform to the opinions of others in the group rather than expressing their own ideas and perspectives.
* Less often: When there is less and less of retros (or request by the team) unless we becoming better at what we do (delivery, predictability, control risk, no stress, good scalable architecture etc) there is need for more and more retro!
* To theme or not to? Themed retros. I made [**this video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDL7vRWLaV4) Tired of same old? want focus? set the scene? Conflicted by barbie retrospective, the gremblins retro, the goonies retrospective? YOU ARE NOT ALONE. In this video we look at what are ACTUALLY themed retros + specific examples with PURPOSE  AND detailed recent session

*“You think that because you understand ‘one’ that you must therefore understand ‘two’ because one and one make two. But you forget that you must also understand ‘and’.” - Sufi teaching story* 

### Antidotes
* Set scene of problem solvers with a common challenge
* Spend time BREAKING dependencies, rather than managing them
* Favour finishing over starting
* Enable voices to be heard: When some team members do not actively participate in the retrospective, which can hinder the team's ability to identify and address problems.
* Move to experiements over broad statements
* Craft time to enable space for actions options generations & selection
* Start check point on previous action and outcome so far. 
* Surface when not moving the needle of improvement (after all this is all it matters "are we becoming better at what we do?"
* Prompt to options diversification, encourage other points of view and reassure healthy challenges as part of the process to get to a better options/views
* Focus on collectively chose 1-2 actions to start trying out next day (least for maximum return)
* Make it fun! sprinkle a bit of laughter can help ease and open minds which enables looking at constrains and reocurring issues with new lens

#### New lens 
Use Systems Thinking, its a way of looking at the world as series of interconnected webs (systems within systems and which are interacting and contradicting)
Systems have multiple layers of context and gives a metaview. </br> </br>
We often focus only on analysis, or what's call reductionism, decompose and check each part isolated. When a single-part optimization is not enough use Synthesis especially when there is high interconnectivity and relationships rather than describe with static properties (as analysis would do) </br> </br>
Check for Elements and Connections, as a system causes its own behaviour. Find small leavers that can make a big difference, a positive one beyond your team. </br>

#### Timing is everything
Are the retros poorly attended? Sometimes can simply be because the meeting is at a bad time or on a bad day. Have you asked? </br>
When would it be good moment in each cadence to do it? (not 'if' to do it, but 'when' to do it)
</br> </br>
