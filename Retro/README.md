In the Scrum framework the **retrospective** is one of the events that is part of amy learning process (I argue here that it should be part of the everyday, regardless of whether you do use Scrum or not). You typically do this at the end of every iteration, let’s say on Fridays. Is one of many feedback loops you want to infuse in a learning system.

## It’s a time to pause and reflect and act as that learning opportunity.

[*Scrum Guide Retrospective ref*] (https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#sprint-retrospective)

A retrospective is an internal event where all team members gather to catch up and review how the iteration went, why was it that way, collaborate with ideas to make it better and agree which ones the team has the energy and is ready to give it a try next week. It should also be a way to make cycle after cycle less painful, more productive and more fun to work.

#### There you have the why, the purpose. Now,

* What [**Indicators**](https://github.com/GarciaInes/Scrum-Mastering/blob/main/Retro/Indicators.md) can measure to know where you stand?

* Which powerful [**Questions**](https://github.com/GarciaInes/Scrum-Mastering/blob/main/Retro/Questions.md) can you ask to help your team?

* Things to be careful of, aka [**Antipatterns**](https://github.com/GarciaInes/Scrum-Mastering/blob/main/Retro/Antipatterns.md)


In retros keep this in mind even read up to the team to set the tone: 
“Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand.”
(aka The Prime Directive - Norm Kerth, Project Retrospectives, retrospectivewiki.org/index.php?title=The_Prime_Directive)

Gear conversations are to be productive because the content is democratically generated. Expectations of share and gain knowledge from others experience. 
Maybe add this quote from Eleanor Roosevelt “Learn from the mistakes of others. You can't live long enough to make them all yourself.” - and is beyond mistakes, but wisdom of what also works. Rich experience where the value is in the individuals and the interactions that it will surface.  

#### Be ready to:
* Level up and give the opportunity to air space for everyone, all voices to be heard
* That also mean manage to reduce the ones with tendency to “hoard the mic“
* Use comparisons to light the conversation, from absolute statements to relative
* We think to approach things differently. And that different take is super valuable!
* Draw wisdowm vs knowledge
* Fight the urge to react, instead be curios: ask questions, challenge status quo
* Avoid “group think” https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupthink
* Beware of confirmation bias
* Act as a mirror to the room (behaviours)
