As a Scrum Master, you do much more than JUST facilitate the meeting, you are an observer of the system with the aim to help the system to find it's way to be it's best. 
And you are definetely not to 'run' the meeting specially it's contents.

At the end of the day they ability for a team to improve their own process, is what makes it or breaks it. 
There is the tendency that overtime teams with lack of guidance will land on dull retrospectives. Helping to revive the why and how of retros is a skill in itself and makes a huuuuge diference! 

Here some questions for you to notice and instrospect:

#### Basics to observe
* Are the commited changes / agreed experiments being implemented?
* Are the raised issues being acted upon by the team members?
* Are the team members holding each other accountable daily?
* Are items raised and worked on as it comes rather than waiting for the retro?
* Are same items reapearing?
* Are things "let go" whilst the issues are still present?
* Do they discuss how they work together? with the intention to make it better?

#### Measure
* Is the team getting better?
* Is the process improving?
* Is the product better?
* Is the energy better?
* Are we more predictable? i.e. we learnt how much we can consume over time?
* Are we controlling risk?
* Have we improved our security?
* Have we improved safety to deliver more often?
* Have we improved safety to try things out?
* When discussing problems, the team focus on those that are within their influence

#### Team self-awareness
* Is co-creation observed?
* Are all voices being heard?
* Is there time to innovate?
* Is there eagerness to try new things?
* Do team members fight the urge to react? 
* instead be curios: ask questions, challenge status quo
* Is the team aware of their own progress to make their process better?

As a scrum master it's useful to help recap past items with the team: 
* The good, the bad and the ugly.
* Are we becoming better at what we do?
* As individuals we often don't realise nor give ourselves credit for what we have achieved.
* This touch point avoids issues raised not being improved on and or lost in the oblivium
