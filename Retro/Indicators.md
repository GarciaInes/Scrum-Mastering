As a Scrum Master, you do much more than JUST facilitate the meeting, you are an observer of the system with the aim to help the system to find it's way to be it's best. 
And you are definetely not to 'run' the meeting specially it's contents.

Here some questions for you to notice and instrospect:

#### Basics to observe
* Are the commited changes / agreed experiments being implemented?
* Are the raised issues being acted upon by the team members?
* Are the team members holding each other accountable daily?
* Are items raised and worked on as it comes rather than waiting for the retro?
* Are same items reapearing?
* Are things "let go" whilst the issues are still present?

#### Measure
* Is the team getting better?
* Is the process improving?
* Is the product better?
* Is the energy better?
* Are we more predictable? i.e. we learnt how much we can consume over time?
* Are we controlling risk?
* Have we improved our security?
* Have we improved safety to deliver more often?
* Have we improved safety to try things out?

#### Team self-awareness
* Is co-creation observed?
* Are all voices being heard?
* Is there time to innovate?
* Is there eagerness to try new things?
* Do team members fight the urge to react? instead be curios: ask questions, challenge status quo

* Is the team aware of their own progress to make their process better?
As a scrum master it's useful to recap past items. As individuals we often don't realise nor give ourselves credit for what we have achieved.
