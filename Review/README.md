## “Feedback is the breakfast of champions.” – Ken Blanchard

[*Scrum Guide Review ref*] (https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#sprint-review)

“In a growth mindset, challenges are exciting rather than threatening. 
So rather than thinking, oh, I’m going to reveal my weaknesses, 
you say, wow, here’s a chance to grow.”
– Carol Dweck
