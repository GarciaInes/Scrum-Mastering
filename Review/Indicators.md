As a Scrum Master, you do much more than JUST facilitate the meeting, you are an observer of the system with the aim to help the system to find it's way to be it's best. 
And you are definetely not to 'run' the meeting specially it's contents.

What was the goal of the sprint? Start there, show the working product (not mocks) even better if the demo is done by the product manager OR by a user, someone that can go throught the new potential product motions.
Ideally you embed in your product UX and monitoring, so upon review you can also present your real data of the new proposed featured. So that it can be assessed if to persevere or to pivot.

#### The review is there to inspect the outcome, even better if you can inspect the IMPACT.
What was the goal?
* reduce churn?
* reduce call center calls
* deflection to chat bot
* increase on public reviews
* purchased of a valuable/relevant add-on 

A side of the product itself, the review it's a great opportunity to flash out what was committed and what was delivered.
The gap in between calls for valuable interaction in review, do you need help? something is working particularly well? what is slowing you down?

New ideas will emerge in REVIEW, and thats OK, it's a GOOD THING!
Capture them, PO to consider and add in backlog > which subsequently needs to be sized, check potential return, check potential interest, validation and feasibility, prioritised and define which bets could be placed.

Here a list of questions for you to notice and instrospect:
#### Basics to observe
* Is the demo of the product increment fully fleshed? (i.e not a mock)
* Does the session deviate away from product increment review?

#### Measure
* Voiced leveled up
* Ability to ask questions
* Response types: ie resistance, welcomed, open discussion...
* Who demos? and how often?

#### Team self-awareness
* Does the whole team participate>
* Does the session get hijacked by stakeholders?
* Who shows up and how often?
