As a Scrum Master, you do much more than JUST facilitate the meeting, you are an observer of the system with the aim to help the system to find it's way to be it's best. 
And you are definetely not to 'run' the meeting specially it's contents.

> ### not just what you can count."

What was the goal of the sprint? Start there, show the working product (not mocks) even better if the demo is done by the product manager OR by a user, someone that can go throught the new potential product motions.
Ideally you embed in your product UX and monitoring, so upon review you can also present your real data of the new proposed featured. So that it can be assessed if to persevere or to pivot.

#### The review is there to inspect the outcome, even better if you can inspect the IMPACT.
What was the goal?
* reduce churn?
* reduce call center calls
* deflection to chat bot
* increase on public reviews
* purchased of a valuable/relevant add-on 

If then in the Sprint Review the Product Owner does the show and tell and runs the demo, that’s even better! 

A side of the product itself, the review it's a great opportunity to flash out what was committed and what was delivered.
The gap in between calls for valuable interaction in review, do you need help? something is working particularly well? what is slowing you down?

New ideas will emerge in REVIEW, and thats OK, it's a GOOD THING!
Capture them, PO to consider and add in backlog > which subsequently needs to be sized, check potential return, check potential interest, validation and feasibility, prioritised and define which bets could be placed.

#### Account for feedback
A good indicator to keep an eye on during the review meeting include the team's responsiveness to feedback. <br/>
* One way to measure this is by assessing the team's ability to incorporate feedback into their work. For example, if a stakeholder suggests a change to a feature during the review meeting, the team should be able to quickly assess the feasibility of the change and determine whether it is in line with the project's goals and objectives. If the change is feasible and aligns with the project goals, the team should be able to incorporate it into their work for the next sprint.

* Another way to measure the team's responsiveness to feedback is by evaluating their communication skills. During the review meeting, the team should be able to communicate effectively and clearly with stakeholders, explaining their work and answering any questions that may arise. The team should also be receptive to feedback and be willing to make adjustments to their work based on that feedback.

* In addition, you can assess the team's ability to adapt to changing requirements and priorities. For example, if the team receives feedback that suggests a change in direction or priority, they should be able to adjust their work accordingly and communicate those changes effectively to stakeholders and other team members.

Here a list of questions for you to notice and introspect:
#### Basics to observe
* Is the demo of the product increment fully fledged? (i.e not a mock)
* (in line with above) Not end to end usable deployed features (ie business logic only, no DB no UI)
* Does the session deviate away from product increment review?
* Is the PO demoing? (ie anyone besides who developed it and tested)

#### Measure
* Obstacles raised (doesnt have a complete block, include: what slow us down)
* Voiced leveled up
* Ability to ask questions
* Response types: ie resistance, welcomed, open discussion...
* Who demos? and how often?

#### Team self-awareness
* Does the whole team participate?
* Does the session get hijacked by stakeholders?
* Who shows up and how often?
