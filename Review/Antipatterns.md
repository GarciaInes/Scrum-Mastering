Things to watch out for

##### Scope Creep
The review helps as much of what we do is 'create' from ideas/concepts to something that can be seen/is interactive. <br/>
So showing the product is superpowerful, and that naturally will prompt to new ideas/enhancements to emerge. Careful with scope creep when may just need to be added in the backlog for PO to order.

##### No clear value
Outline the goal and play back the 'translation' from conceptual aim to actual/tangible deliverable.<br/>
Focus on concise updates on achieved and also the review is a great place to surface obstacles.

##### Too big pieces of work
How can the core value be delivered to focus on what brings the most return with the least effort/time?

##### Silos
Observe behaviour, are we collaborating beyond ones boundries, is there always the same showing the product? or the section of a product?

##### Noisy / too long
Too big of baglock, covering too much in one seating should be an energising review of top items in the backlog. <br/>
After all the review is a working session not a talkshow/presentation.

### WATCH OUT
* Fake demo
* not done-done items
* spill overs
* not surfacing what 'is slowing us down'
* not my work > not my attention
* disrupted/controlled by outsiders
