# Scrum-Mastering

First off, THANK YOU for considering contributing to Scrum-Mastery:

## THE Open-source project in GitHub for Scrum Masters to chip in add additions to it > to help &amp; learn from each other with the Scrum Framework.

- Itâ€™s people like you that make it such a great tool.
- Your contributions help make an Agile journey with Scrum better for everyone, developers and non-developers alike.
- Also is a great way to grow your skills and help others. Whatever your skill level, working on open-source is a great way to learn new things.
- Let's build upon each others ideas as we enable and encourage our teams to do.
- Make a suggestion, fix a bug, improve documentation, or contribute code to a project. Even asking questions helps.

As you have landed here, please make sure you familiarise yourself with:
- The project licence file (Also accounts for any reference, use, view etc of this open-source project)
- CONTRIBUTING & CODE_OF_CONDUCT files

**With the motto to keep things simple, we have a base folder structure by each Scrum ceremony in each a file containing:**
- **Antipatters** : Things to watch out for that may spoil the broth for your team
- **Questions** : Powerful yet simple to help reflection, act as ignator, open posibilities, etc ultimately to serve the team. Good to have in your backpocket.
- **Indicators** : How do we measure what works? Keeping Systems Thinking at hand so that signle metrics don't damage the goodness of the whole. Think of them as leading indicators of a healthy team/product/organisation

Scrum ceremonies gives us rhythm and checkpoints, hence the idea to segregate the content on each of those.

### How to contribute to an Open-Project
A guide to making open source contributions, for first-timers and for veterans. [Check this!](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/)

You may be new to GitHub, is a simple way to collaborate on content across multiple files and folders, without overriding each other work and building upon each other ideas. See below to get started:
**Check out this quick tutorial to get you up and running with your first open-source contribution in less than 5 minutes: https://www.youtube.com/embed/dSl_qnWO104**
1. Create a GitHub user if you do not have one
2. Fork the repository (select the account you want to fork it to) - you will have a copy under you now
3. Clone/Download files so that you can work/edit the files on your machine OR change files directly if you are not familiar with CLI and/or code editor.
4. Once you are ready > commit changes (use comments to briefly describe which changes for mantainer) & Push changes
5. Create a Pull Request from Master (original repo) compare the changes
6. The project mantainer will review changes and communicate for the best contribution it can be!

Text and markdown files are perfect formats, see here [how to add formating](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
