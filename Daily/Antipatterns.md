Listing below some anti-patterns often observed in teams

### "Doing"
Activities and a lot of 'ing' repeating day after day
* Antidote: Craft a clear goal, tweak the narrative so that each daily is in fact a team alignment to fill the gap on current and meeting the goal. (everything else does not matter)
* Another Antidote is to rephase the narrative like if it was a retrospective: 1) what did we set ourselves to do yesterday? 2) how did that go? 3) how could we try today for it to be better? then pick whats the aim to finish today, anything may slow us down and how to mitigate. 4) with that in mind, are we well in line to achive our goal? if not, what adjustemnts to do on plan/scope today to make it.

### No Routine
There isn't a rythm on when what how who
* Antidote: Get that muscle memory going! Same time, same place, for & by the team, max 15 mins alignment.
* Antidote: Get a dynamic habit, such as every day someone else shares screen, or open up with 'who wants to start' + pass the baton

### Status Report
When it misses the point of what a daily is about
* Antidote: Back to basics, reafirm the aim and benefit WIIIFM (What is in it for me)

### Silos
When team members talks about their ticket, their bit, you can observe the behaviour and reactions of the rest of the team. what does that tell you? where is the cohesiveness? where is the attentiveness? where is the enriching each other work?
* Antidote: nothing work as well as act as a mirror, you can also ask questions and get others involved on related content from someone else 'update'

### Ticket Numbers
Playing bingo calling ticket numbers rather than mentioning the value work
* Antidote: shift to talk on what we work on, how could we help each other as we understandibly dont clutter our brain memorising useless ticket numbers. Talk VALUE to me.

### Problem Solving
Avoid jumping into solutionsing, pointers are useful, yet dont deviate
* Antidote: it's ok to have a further discusion in depth after daily once the team has aligned for the next 24h

### No Red Dots
*Wikipedia*: A red dot sight is a common classification for a type of non-magnifying reflector sight for firearms, and other devices that require aiming, that gives the user a point of aim in the form of an illuminated red dot.
* Antidote: prompt questions to help the team to surface those

### Monologs
Does everyone have a similar air time? Do people contribute to each other plan for the next 24h?
* Antidote: its ok to pause, and gear back to 1 aim to finish today (towards common goal) and 2 what slowing one down

### Assignments
The daily isn't a place to assign tickets, in fact noone should 'command' who does what. 
* Antidote: The team is to self organise, ideally picking next item from the top of backlog if all other items doesnt need any humanly possible help to move them to done-done

### Cluelessness
Lack of synch within the team, no clear idea
* Antidote: refocus on the goal, what are we showing as working increment on Friday?

### Shift Starter
when the daily becomes a wake up alarm
* Antidote: tweak the semantics, from yesterday to today to achieved since last time and plan to finish until next time we do one of these.

### Overcrowded
Too many people who don't bring value
* Antidote: refocus, thats for and by the team, anyone else or updates their input last 24h towards common goal and plan to finish next 24h towards common goal, or out. Reduce noise, bring focus.

### Not my update not my problem
do we actually listen to each other?
* Antidote: pass the baton, at least helps to keep attention on who has given their update to nominate who goes next.

### Diversion
Talking about non 'goal' related stuff
* Antidotes:  </br>
. refocus 
. tweak the semantics to cover towards the goal. 
. kind reminders of: if its not about the goal it doesnt exist?

### Micromanagement
Obsessing with tasks or the development process, which in turn kills autonomy and creativity, leading to lower quality work. It shows a lack of trust and freedom.
* Antidotes: </br>
. Set common boundaries: so that there is a shared understanding of acceptable behaviour within and to the team. </br>
. Prioritise: Favour finishing things over starting! Poke with probing questions here. Delegate (or tap into for help) to avoid attempted external distractions (yes that includes who shouts louder demanding). </br>
. Respect: Demonstrating through and by perspectives and opinions can help build trust. Listen actively, consider their ideas, and show appreciation for their contributions. Remind others of positive intent. </br>
. Be flexible: The only constant is change, expect the unexpected. and tap into the team as a collective to make informed decisions, even deferring to next cycle. </br>
. Collaborate: the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. #StrongerTogether </br>
. Measure! Log micromanagement indicators and aggregate so that it can be an information radiator to address unhelpful behaviours. </br>
