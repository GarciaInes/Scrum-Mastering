As a Scrum Master, you do much more than JUST facilitate the meeting, you are an observer of the system with the aim to help the system to find it's way to be it's best. 

Here a list of questions for you to notice and instrospect:
#### Basics to observe
* punctual?
* same time same place
* constant rhythm?
* Concise updates on what was Achieved last 24h & plan to Finish next 24h?
* Gives clarity & progress as a whole towards the common goal
* Are problems & impediments being surfaced?

#### Measure
* Do they encourage each other to share work early, rather than wait for 'perfect'?
* Scope & bureaucracy creep are snapped nice & early
* The team adjust & offers help when items are slowing the aim down
* When someone finish a task, they check if they can help someone else to finish theirs.
* Account for side tracked mentions pof 'other things' not goal
* Note on volume activity updates rather the value achieved (it's just too easy to be 'busy')

#### Team self-awareness
* Does the Whole team participate?
* Team meets throughout the day for more detailed discussions & progress when needed
* Are team members surface when is not clear the progress/feasibility of that common goal?
* Do we hold each other accountable, for what we signed up to do?

#### Aging Work in Progress
Is the amount of time an unfinished task has (usually measured in days), it helps us identify issues that are staled
* Try to find those issues that are taking longer or close to than your average Cycle Time
* You can create your own charts with the differente states in your workflow in your x axis and the # of days in the y axis


At the end of the day, daily is there as a touch point for aligment and for the team to adjust their plan for the next 24h so that the Sprint Goal can in fact be achieved. Keeping time and quality fixed, whilst adjusting how to make it happen as a collective.
* Is this happening?
* Are the updates valuable for all team members?
* Do the team jump in with comments/help to others updates?
* Are outstanding items followed by the team after the daily?
