As a Scrum Master, you do much more than JUST facilitate the meeting:
You are an observer of the system with the aim of helping the system to find its way to be its best. 

Here is a list of questions for you to notice and introspect:
#### Basics to observe
* within 15 mins?
* punctual? members joining on time and wrapping on time?
* same time same place
* constant rhythm?
* semantics "ing': working, progressing, doing...
* Concise updates on what was achieved last 24h & plan to Finish next 24h?
* Gives clarity & progress as a whole towards the common goal
* Are problems & impediments being surfaced?

#### Measure
* Do they encourage each other to share work early, rather than wait for 'perfect'?
* Scope & bureaucracy creep are snapped nice & early
* The team adjust & offers help when items are slowing the aim down
* When someone finishes a task, they check if they can help someone else to finish theirs.
* Account for sidetracked mentions of 'other things' not goal
* Note on volume activity updates rather than the value achieved (it's just too easy to be 'busy')

#### Team self-awareness
* Does the Whole team participate?
* Team meets throughout the day for more detailed discussions & progress when needed
* Are team members surface when is not clear the progress/feasibility of that common goal?
* Do we hold each other accountable, for what we signed up to do?

#### Aging Work in Progress
Is the amount of time an unfinished task has (usually measured in days), it helps us identify issues that are staled
* Try to find those issues that are taking longer or close to your average Cycle Time
* You can create your own charts with the different states in your workflow on your x axis and the # of days on the y axis

#### Spotting Micromanagement
* Hierarchy assigns work (Lack of autonomy to make decisions and take ownership of work)
* Excessive oversight (When monitoring removes focus, energy & headspace)
* Resistance to change (If you don't evolve you go backwards)
* Focus on pressure rather than return
* Decreased energy (can be consumed by micromanagement)
* Not end-to-end usable deployed features (ie business logic only, no DB no UI)
* Low quality (from rushing to complete work and long hours)
</br>

At the end of the day, daily is there as a touch point for alignment and for the team to adjust their plan for the next 24h so that the Sprint Goal can in fact be achieved. Keeping time and quality fixed, whilst adjusting how to make it happen as a collective.
* Is this happening?
* Are the updates valuable for all team members?
* Do the team jump in with comments/help to others updates?
* Are outstanding items followed by the team after the daily?
