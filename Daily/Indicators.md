As a Scrum Master, you do much more than JUST facilitate the meeting, you are an observer of the system with the aim to help the system to find it's way to be it's best. 

Here a list of questions for you to notice and instrospect:
* Does the Whole team participate?
* Are problems & impediments being surfaced?
* Concise updates on what was Achieved last 24h & plan to Finish next 24h?
* Gives clarity & progress as a whole towards the common goal
* Are team members surface when is not clear the progress/feasibility of that common goal?
* The team adjust & offers help when items are slowing the aim down
* Do we hold each other accountable, for what we signed up to do?
* Scope & bureaucracy creep are snapped nice & early
* Team meets throughout the day for more detailed discussions & progress when needed

At the end of the day, daily is there as a touch point for aligment and for the team to adjust their plan for the next 24h so that the Sprint Goal can in fact be achieved. Keeping time and quality fixed, whilst adjusting how to make it happen as a collective.
* Is this happening?
* Are the updates valuable for all team members?
* Do the team jump in with comments/help to others updates?
* Are outstanding items followed by the team after the daily?
