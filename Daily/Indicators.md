As a Scrum Master, you do much more than JUST facilitate the meeting, you are an observer. 

Here a list of questions for you to notice and instrospect:
* Does the Whole team participate?
* Are problems & impediments being surfaced?
* Concise updates on what was Achieved last 24h & plan to Finish next 24h?
* Gives clarity & progress as a whole towards the common goal
* Are team members surface when is not clear the progress/feasibility of that common goal?
* The team adjust & offers help when items are slowing the aim down
* Do we hold each other accountable, for what we signed up to do?
* Scope & bureaucracy creep are snapped nice & early
* Team meets throughout the day for more detailed discussions & progress when needed
