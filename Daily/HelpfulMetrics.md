As a Scrum Master, you need to be in alert to reduce waste as soon as it appears.

#### For that, you can offer to the team a very helpful metric for their dailies: Aging Work in Progress.
* The amount of time an unfinished task has (usually measured in days)
* It helps us identify issues that are taking longer than expected
* It increases the predictability and efficiency of our team

#### How to track it?
* You can use tools such as Actionable Agile
* You can create your own charts with the differente states in your workflow in your x axis and the # of days in the y axis

#### What to look for?
* Try to find those issues that are taking longer or close to than your average Cycle Time
* Unblock them ASAP so you respect your WIP limits
