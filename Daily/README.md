In the Scrum framework the **Daily** is one of the events keeps all eyes on the goal of your cycle/sprint. You do this evry day during an iteration, let’s say for a weekly one Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays & Fridays (excluding Monday if its when you have done planning).

A Daily Scrum is there to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal & adapt the Sprint as necessary to collectively achieve the common goal.

## Out of sight... out of mind. Reduce deviation focus on the goal

Daily Scrums improve communications, identify impediments, promote quick decision-making, and consequently eliminate the need for other meetings.

15 mins every day same time same place, run by and for the team, brings clarity and alignment.

## Run FOR and BY the team
Each team member typically answers these 3 questions:
* What have I ACHIEVED since yesterday
* What am I planning to FINISH today
* Is there something slowing me/us down?

"Tendency to start things.
Start things it’s easy.
Finish is not.
Only finished things bring value.
Having many in progress things do not" - Ines Garcia
